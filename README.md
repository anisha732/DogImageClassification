# Overview
This project applies Neural Networks to a dataset of dog images. In this project, each dog image is classified by its breed by training several models in efforts to determine the model with the highest accuracy score. 

# Business Problem
There are about 200 dog breeds in the world right now, which can make differing breeds from one another rather difficult. When dogs are rescued and taken to shelters, it can be benefical to determine which breed they are for medical reasons (certain breeds have different medical conditions) and so that they can find a forever home as fast as possible (if someone has a breed preference). Additionally, this classification system can also be useful to landlords who are renting out homes and only allow certain dog breeds.

# Data 
The data in this project was pulled from Kaggle and includes 20,580 images of 120 different dog breeds. The link to the data: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset

There is no significant class imbalance issue, however it is evident that the breed with the most images are Maltese and least is Redbone.

# Model Evaluation

DATFRAME WITH ALL MODELS COMPARISON

After running several models, the model with the highest accuracy score is the InceptionNet Model with an accuracy score of 92.5%.
